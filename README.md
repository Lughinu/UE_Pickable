# UE_Pickable
Unreal Engine 5, small demo game. 

Game Design:
It is an endless game. 
A 3rd person character needs to reach spawned objects to avoid certain death.

There is an UI with an health bar <br />
Health bar value automatically decreases when the time pass.<br />
special objects will be spawned in the level<br />
when main character overlaps with one of this special object, health bar increase a bit<br />

GAME GOAL:
player has to move the character and reach these special objects to keep health bar value positive 

GAME OVER:
If the health bar reaches zero, then main character dies


Most of the code is in cpp, the rest is in Blueprint
